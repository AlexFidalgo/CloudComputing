    "\n",
    "Both **Deployment** and **StatefulSet** are types of workload resources used to manage the lifecycle of applications. Stateless applications do not retain any client data (or \"state\") between requests. Each request from a client is treated as an independent transaction that is unrelated to any previous request. Stateful applications maintain state across client interactions; this means that they remember previous interactions and use this information to influence future interactions.\n",

    "**Deployment:** Suitable for stateless applications like web servers, APIs, or other services where any instance of the application can handle incoming requests.\n",

    "Horizontal scaling means that the response to increased load is to deploy more Pods. Vertical scaling means assigning more resources (for example: memory or CPU) to the Pods that are already running for the workload.\n",

This is why the `wget: bad address 'php-apache'` error occurs and why `nslookup` can't resolve the service name. The reason there are no endpoints for the `php-apache` service is likely due to the pod being in a `CrashLoopBackOff` state. This state indicates that the pod is repeatedly failing to start.\n",
