    "\n",
    "- **On-demand self-service.** A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Broad network access.** Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Resource pooling.** The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rapid elasticity.** Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Measured service.** Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.\n"

The cloud infrastructure can be viewed as containing both a physical layer and an abstraction layer. The physical layer consists of the hardware resources that are necessary to support the cloud services being provided, and typically includes server, storage and network components. The abstraction layer consists of the software deployed across the physical layer, which manifests the essential cloud characteristics. Conceptually the abstraction layer sits above the physical layer.\n",

    "##### Formal Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- The authors develop a model of a third-generation-like computer system, specifying necessary assumptions about its behavior, state-space, and state transitions.\n",
    "- The model includes a processor with supervisor and user modes, relocation registers for memory addressing, and a set of conventional instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Conditions for Virtualization\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper establishes a critical condition for an architecture to support virtualization:\n",
    "- **Sensitive Instructions**: Instructions that can affect the hardware state in a way that could interfere with the operation of the VMM must be a subset of the privileged instructions. This ensures that any sensitive operation will trap to the VMM, allowing it to maintain control over system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Major Theorems\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Theorem 1**: For any conventional third-generation computer, a VMM can be constructed if the set of sensitive instructions is a subset of the privileged instructions.\n",
    "2. **Theorem 2**: A conventional third generation computer is recursively virtualizable if it is virtualizable and a VMM without timing dependencies can be constructed for it.\n",
    "3. **Theorem 3**: A hybrid virtual machine monitor (HVM) can be constructed for any conventional third generation machine where user-sensitive instructions are a subset of privileged instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Practical Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "- The formal techniques provided in the paper can be applied to evaluate existing architectures and design new architectures to support virtualization.\n",
    "- The results have been used to modify existing systems, such as the DEC PDP-11/45, to support virtual machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper concludes that while the model captures essential aspects of third generation virtual machines, some simplifications were made for presentation purposes. Empirical evidence suggests that additional complexities, such as I/O operations and asynchronous events, can be integrated into the model. The formal techniques outlined may also be applied to newer architectures designed to support virtualization without traditional VMM overhead.\n"

    "Virtualization is a core technology used for the implementation of cloud computing. It increases the utilization of resources such as processor, storage, network etc. by collecting various underutilized resources available in the form of a shared pool of resources built through the creation of Virtual Machines (VMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirements in cloud environment are dynamic therefore there is always a need to move virtual machines within the same cloud or amongst different clouds. This is achieved through migration of VMs which results in several benefits such as saving energy of the host, managing fault tolerance if some host is not working properly and load balancing among all hosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud is a parallel and distributed computing system consisting of a **collection of inter connected and virtualized computers that are dynamically provisioned and presented as one or more unified computing resources** based on service level agreement (SLA) established through negotiation between the service provider and consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtualization creates an abstract layer over the actual hardware and software. It emulates a physical machine in software to run multiple operating systems on single machine hardware. The main goal of virtualization is to utilize the maximum capacity of available resources such as processor, storage and network. By creating virtual machines, it collaborates multiple unutilized resources into a shared resource pool and utilizes them by performing different tasks simultaneously to fulfill multiple user demands. These resources can be scaled on virtual machines (i.e. allocated dynamically).\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be various types of virtualizations like -\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Application Virtualization** – In this, application/s including operating system of host machine is moved to the virtual environment. It is a technology in which the application is present somewhere else but is accessed by the client computer. The application behaves same as the local application on the client system. For example - VMWare Thinapp, Oracle secure Global desktop, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Storage Virtualization** – It provides a virtual storage environment by collecting or combining various physical storages. Through this, distributed storage is managed in such a way as if it is one consolidated storage. After this virtualization, the availability of storage increases because now the applications do not have limited or a specific resource. The storage can be updated any time without affecting the performance of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Server Virtualization** – In this, existing server is moved into a virtual environment i.e. hypervisor, which is hosted on a physical server. The resources of server are hidden from clients and the physical server is divided into multiple virtual environments. Web server virtualization is one of the most popular examples of this technology used for providing low cost web hosting services.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hardware Virtualization** – This virtualization makes hardware components of real machine as virtual components. This technology hides all the physical components and details of actual computing platform from end users.\n"
